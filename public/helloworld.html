                <p>My name is <strong>Tariq Sharif Hafiz</strong>. I am 26 years old, and dream of one day being a <em>Physicist</em>. This coding class is the first step of a journey that will span my lifetime. <br> It is my hope to work at the LHC <em>- or Large Hadron Collider -</em> located at <strong>CERN</strong> in Switzerland. To that end, I feel that I must begin preparing my skillset for the challenges I will face in the future. <br> with any <em>luck</em> I will be able to diligently work on expanding my understanding of the universe, and help to solve <strong>mysteries</strong> as old as the very cosmos itself.</p>

                <h2>My Favorite Quotes</h2>
                <blockquote>“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. <br>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. <br>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. <br>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. <br>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.” - Dr. Carl Sagan</blockquote><a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/earth/pale-blue-dot.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">View Carl Sagan's Full Quote</a><br>

                <blockquote>"I could not sleep for thinking of the sky, <br>The unending sky, with all its million suns <br>Which turn their planets everlastingly <br>In nothing, where the fire-haired comet runs. <br><br>If I could sail that nothing, I should cross <br>Silence and emptiness with dark stars passing, <br>Then, in the darkness, see a point of gloss <br>Burn to a glow, and glare, and keep amassing, <br><br>And rage into a sun with wandering planets <br>And drop behind, and then, as I proceed, <br>See his last light upon his last moon's granites <br>Die to a dark that would be night indeed. <br><br>Night where my soul might sail a million years <br>In nothing, not even Death, not even tears." - John Masefield, Lollingdon Downs Stanza 12, 1917</blockquote> <a href="http://archive.org/stream/lollingdondownsoth00maseuoft/lollingdondownsoth00maseuoft_djvu.txt" target="_blank">View Sonnet</a>

                <p>I dream of owning a Tesla Model S, electric car. It has always been a dream of mine to drive an electric car. With aspirations for the future and a mind dreaming of possibilities, I agree with Elon Musk's assessments of where future world is, and how best we get there.</p>
